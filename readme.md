# TomDo

TomDo is my personal todo management app. It brings together services to help me manage my life and imporove myself. 

## Services Integrated:
- Habitica

## Service Integrations Planned:
- Apple Health
- Runna
- Planfit

## Roadmap
- [x] Get todos from Habitica
- [ ] Implement auth system
- [x] Get habits from Habitica
- [ ] Get health data from Apple Health
- [ ] Update todos in Habitica
- [ ] Update habits in Habitica
- [ ] Create todos in Habitica
- [ ] Create habits in Habitica
- [ ] Create webhooks for specific habits (e.g. tracking water etc)
- [ ] Programmatically create weight goal todos in Habitica (once a week, get current weight, deduct the specified amount, and create a new Habitica todo with a deadline of the same day the following week) 

# Other Functionality Worth Thinking About

I'd like to create some sort of journalling system integrated into this app that logs habits to Habitica. I don't know if this journal would use an external service or just be stored as a model within the Laravel application.
